session_date: "2025-12-27"
project: ChromaNet
milestones:
  - Full blueprint populated in Google Docs (serves as Blueprint.v1.yaml)
  - Clarified MCP architecture: CDT → Snowball → Tailscale → Slate JSON-RPC
  - Identified bootstrap dependency: gl-inet-mcp must exist before MCP-assisted setup
  - Attempted Phase 1 bootstrap — hit connection issues, paused for replanning
decisions:
  - decision: Postpone hardware bootstrap until gl-inet-mcp exists
    rationale: MCP service is prerequisite for assisted router management
    impact: Manual bootstrap required first, then MCP takes over for ongoing config
  - decision: Matt will manually bootstrap Slate offline
    rationale: Resolve USB tethering and WiFi connection issues without session pressure
    impact: Slate on Tailnet with known 100.x.x.x IP before next session
  - decision: Next session focuses on building gl-inet-mcp
    rationale: Follows Matt's regimented MCP build process
    impact: Service ready on Snowball when Slate comes online
blockers:
  - gl-inet-mcp service does not exist on Snowball
  - Slate not yet on Tailnet (pending manual bootstrap)
next_steps:
  - priority: high
    task: Matt manually bootstraps Slate — laptop on Slate WiFi, iPhone USB as WAN, install Tailscale, note 100.x.x.x IP
  - priority: high
    task: Build gl-inet-mcp on Snowball using MCP build process (next session)
  - priority: medium
    task: Resume Phase 3+ from blueprint once MCP service operational
context: |
  Blueprint complete in Google Docs. Hardware on hand but not configured.
  Key insight: Tailscale is fundamental to MCP control — Snowball needs route to Slate.
  iPhone USB tethering failed (no "1 connection" shown) — likely cable or trust issue.
  Laptop-to-Slate WiFi also failed — not yet diagnosed.
  Matt to resolve both manually, then next session builds MCP service.
