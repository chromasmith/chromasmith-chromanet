session_date: "2025-12-27"
project: ChromaNet

milestones:
  - Created chromasmith-chromanet repo with full .forge structure
  - Surveyed 6 repos to identify blueprint storage patterns
  - Established blueprint pattern: .forge/blueprint/Blueprint.v1.yaml (synclips-platform style)
  - Created BRIEF.yaml with complete system context
  - Documented hardware inventory, network scenarios, and MCP architecture

decisions:
  - decision: Use synclips-platform pattern for blueprint storage
    rationale: Blueprint is substantial (~600 lines), may split into multiple files later
    impact: Full blueprint at .forge/blueprint/Blueprint.v1.yaml, terse brief at .forge/BRIEF.yaml

  - decision: Shadow uses different subnet than Slate
    rationale: Avoid IP conflict when both routers active
    impact: Shadow at 192.168.9.1, Slate at 192.168.8.1

  - decision: Defer Speedify bonding
    rationale: $90/year cost, cannot run with ExpressVPN, Multi-WAN failover sufficient for now
    impact: Use Slate's built-in Multi-WAN failover instead

blockers: []

next_steps:
  - priority: high
    task: Populate Blueprint.v1.yaml with full converted content from source markdown
  - priority: high
    task: Phase 1 bootstrap — power on Slate, iPhone USB tethering, initial setup
  - priority: high
    task: Phase 2 — install Tailscale on Slate, join to Tailnet
  - priority: medium
    task: Phase 3 — configure ExpressVPN with Tailscale/Anthropic bypass rules
  - priority: medium
    task: Phase 4 — build gl-inet-mcp service on Snowball

context: |
  Planning complete. Full blueprint exists as markdown in Claude Web conversation.
  Repo scaffolded with stubs. Next session: convert markdown blueprint to YAML,
  then begin physical bootstrap with Slate AX hardware.
